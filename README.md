# Quantik

Disclaimer: Quantik is a GIGAMIC wooden board game my familly bought last Christmas. This open source project aim was to developp a small IA (using alpha pruning minmax algorithm) to be able to play alone, while you must be two to play the original Game.

I'm not affiliated by any ways to GIGAMIC and this project is a totally free working POC in the browser.

If you like the game, I strongly encourage you to buy the original version of it. Here is [an Amazon affiliate link](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B07YN2YRM4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1642&creative=6746&creativeASIN=B07YN2YRM4&linkCode=as2&tag=guillaumepoti-21&linkId=5e4c14952269b4674511f3d6b0282fcb) to buy one if you like my work.
